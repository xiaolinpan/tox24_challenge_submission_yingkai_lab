# README

This repository contains scripts for fine-tuning and predicting using models trained on the Tox24 dataset. Below are the descriptions of the files:

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `finetune_Tox24_run2_fold_1.sh`
- This script fine-tunes a pre-trained model on the Tox24 dataset using one of the 5-fold splits.

### 2. `make_prediction_tox24_1.sh`
- This script runs predictions on the train, test, and leaderboard sets using the model trained on the Tox24 training set.

### 3. `make_prediction_tox24_2.sh`
- This script runs predictions on the train, test, and leaderboard sets using the model trained on both the Tox24 training set and the leaderboard set.

## Notes
- Ensure the required environment and dependencies are set up before running these scripts.
- Replace paths and parameters within the scripts as needed for your specific setup.
